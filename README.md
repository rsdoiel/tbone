version 0.0.1-b
---------------

Bones is a small collection of libraries in Go, JavaScript and PHP designed for HTML generation. It is based on an article by Jason Grosman, "Behind the Code: Avoiding Spaghetti"; http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/02/02/126312263/behind-the-code-avoiding-spaghetti-html.

The go version started as vehicle for me to start learning the basics of the Go language and practice.  Hopefully it will prove useful for others. It is licensed under the New BSD License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)

The JavaScript version should run under NodeJS or in your web browser. The tests for the JavaScript implementation expect to be run in NodeJS.

I wrote the PHP version as just a proof that the concept could be carried between three different languages.
