=====
version 0.0.1
-------------

TBone is an small library for generating valid HTML. It is available in three languages - Go, JavaScript and PHP. It is based on an article by Jason Grosman, "Behind the Code: Avoiding Spaghetti"; http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/02/02/126312263/behind-the-code-avoiding-spaghetti-html.

I started with the go version as a vehicle to learn the language. I then realized that I liked the approach and implemented version in JavaScript and PHP. Hopefully it will prove useful for others. It is licensed under the New BSD License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)

The JavaScript version is intended to run in both the browser and in NodeJS. The test suite is implemented in NodeJS.
